# TypeScript and React coding guidelines
by Giuseppe and the development team


## Introduction
This project contains a simple webpack/TypeScript/React pipeline that is used as the basis for the Hoppinger coding guidelines for building SPA's.

Our final goal is to write code in a way that is standardized across projects, reliable, and that promotes the reuse of code between project with as little dependencies as possible.

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/src/guidelines.md)



## Running
Start by downloading all dependencies with: `yarn install`.

To compile: `yarn build`.
To compile with watch (automatically recompiles as files change): `yarn watch`.
To run the test project: `yarn preview`.
